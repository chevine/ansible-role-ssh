# GSSAPI Authentication ------------------------------------------------------
# Note that these options apply to protocol version 2 only.

# Specifies whether user authentication based on GSSAPI is allowed.
# The default is ''no''.
sshd_gssapi_auth: 'no'
# Specifies whether key exchange based on GSSAPI is allowed.
# GSSAPI key exchange doesn't rely on ssh keys to verify host identity.
# The default is ''no''.
sshd_gssapi_cleanup_credentials: 'yes'
# Specifies whether to automatically destroy the user's credentials cache
# on logout.
# The default is ''yes''.
sshd_gssapi_strict_accept_or_check: 'yes'
# Determines whether to be strict about the identity of the GSSAPI acceptor
# a client authenticates against. If ''yes'' then the client must authenticate
# against the host service on the current hostname. If ''no'' then the client
# may authenticate against any service key stored in the machine's default
# store. This facility is provided to assist with operation on multi homed
# machines. The default is ''yes''. Note that this option applies only to
# protocol version 2 GSSAPI connections, and setting it to ''no'' may only
# work with recent Kerberos GSSAPI libraries.
sshd_gssapi_key_exchange: 'no'
# Controls whether the user's GSSAPI credentials should be updated following
# a successful connection rekeying. This option can be used to accepted
# renewed or updated credentials from a compatible client.
# The default is ''no''.
sshd_gssapi_store_credentials_on_rekey: 'no'
